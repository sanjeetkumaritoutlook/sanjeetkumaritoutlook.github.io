     <h1>GitHub Pages</h1>
     <p>GitHub Pages are GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub public repositories for no additional cost.</p>
     <p>GitHub Pages are public web pages for users, organizations, and repositories, that are freely hosted on GitHub’s github.io domain or on a custom domain name of your choice. GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll behind the scenes, so they’re a great way to host your Jekyll-powered website for free.</p>
     <p>GitHub Pages will look for an index.html , index.md , or README.md file as the entry file for your site. </p>
     <p>For this convert an existing repo into Github Pages (or) create a new public repository named <b>username.github.io</b>, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.</p>

     <h1>GitHub Pages is a free hosting service</h1>
     <p>GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub, since 2008 and it allows you to publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It is particularly popular for personal portfolios, documentation sites, blogs, and small web projects. Here's an overview:</p><br></br>
    <p>GitHub Pages is widely used for projects like documentation, small apps, or even full-fledged personal portfolios due to its simplicity and seamless integration with GitHub.</p>
     <strong>Key Features:
     </strong>
     <p><strong>Free Hosting: </strong><br></br> GitHub Pages offers free hosting for static websites, with support for custom domains.<br></br>
     <strong>Version Control: </strong> Websites hosted on GitHub Pages are tied to Git repositories, so every change to your site is versioned.<br></br>
     <strong>Easy Deployment: </strong> By pushing code to specific branches (e.g., main, gh-pages) of your GitHub repository, GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys the website.<br></br>
     <strong>Jekyll Support: </strong> GitHub Pages has built-in support for Jekyll, a static site generator, making it easy to create blogs or documentation sites.<br></br>
     <strong>HTTPS Support:  </strong>GitHub Pages automatically provides HTTPS for your site, ensuring secure connections.<br></br></p>
    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong><br></br>
    <strong>Static Content:</strong> GitHub Pages is for static websites only; it doesn't support server-side code like PHP or databases.<br></br>
    <strong>Traffic Limits:</strong> There's a soft limit on bandwidth and size, but it is sufficient for most small to medium-sized sites.<br></br>
    <strong>Customization:</strong> Advanced customization may require integrating build tools or manually configuring settings.<br></br></p>
     <h1>Multiple Github pages for multiple repositories</h1>
     <p>In addition to the user/organization site, you can also have project sites for any other repository. The URL for each of these will be in the format https://<b>username</b>.github.io/repository-name.</p><p>
<ul><li>	You can create as many project repositories as you like and enable GitHub Pages on them individually.</li><li>
For each repository, you can enable GitHub Pages under the repository's settings, selecting a branch to host the site (typically main or gh-pages).</li></ul>
<br></br>Example Setup:<br></br>
1.	Repository 1 (repo1):<br></br>
<ul><li>	GitHub Pages URL: https://username.github.io/repo1</li><li>
You can configure this repository to host a website by enabling GitHub Pages in the repository's settings.</li></ul><br></br>
2.	Repository 2 (repo2):
<ul><li>GitHub Pages URL: https://username.github.io/repo2</li><li>
	Similarly, you can enable GitHub Pages on this repository, and it will host a different website.</li></ul><br></br>
How to set up GitHub Pages for a project repository:<br></br>
<ol><li>	Go to the repository you want to use for GitHub Pages.</li>
<li>	In the repository, go to Settings then Pages (located under the "Code and automation" section).</li>
<li>Select the branch you want to use for the Pages site (usually main or gh-pages).</li>
<li>Choose the folder (like /root or /docs)  or "GitHub Actions and workflow" whichever if applicable.</li>
<li>Save the settings, and your site will be live at https://username.github.io/repository-name.</li></ol><br></br>
This way, you can have multiple repositories, each with its own GitHub Pages site.

<h1>GitHub Pages for a private repository</h1>
<p>you can use GitHub Pages for a private repository, but there are a few important points to keep in mind:<br></br>
<br></br>

Key Details:<br></br>
<strong>GitHub Pages for Private Repositories:</strong><br></br>
<br></br>

GitHub Pages can be enabled for private repositories if you have a <strong>GitHub Pro, Team, or Enterprise</strong> plan. Free plans support GitHub Pages only for public repositories.<br></br>
<img 
            src={imagePath3}
            style={{
              width: '100%',
              height: '250px',
            }}
            loading="lazy"
        />
<strong>Visibility of the Pages:</strong><br></br>

When using GitHub Pages with a private repository, the website generated can still be publicly accessible. The content hosted on GitHub Pages does not inherit the repository's privacy status, so anyone with the link can access it unless further restrictions are applied (e.g., custom access controls).<br></br>
<br></br>
<strong>Restrictions for Private Repositories:</strong>
<br></br>
Ensure that sensitive or confidential information is not included in the repository, as it could inadvertently become exposed through the GitHub Pages site.<br></br></p>
      <h1>GitHub Actions</h1>
      <p>GitHub Actions is required in scenario where entry file of a repository is not at root directory and the repository is of a framework like React, Angular, StencilJS</p>
      <p>GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.</p>
    <p>GitHub Actions goes beyond just DevOps and lets you run workflows when other events happen in your repository. For example, you can run a workflow to automatically add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository.</p>
    <p>You can configure a GitHub Actions workflow to be triggered when an event occurs in your repository, such as a pull request being opened or an issue being created. Your workflow contains one or more jobs which can run in sequential order or in parallel.</p>
      <p>A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.</p>
